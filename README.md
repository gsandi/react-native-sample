LoginNPush is a basic app where users can sign in to the app using their Google accounts. 
Upon login, the user is greeted with a Good morning/Good afternoon/Good evening message, depending on the time of the day.
The background image upon login also varies depending on the time of the day.
The logged in user can send and receive Push Notifications to get the current time from the server.
